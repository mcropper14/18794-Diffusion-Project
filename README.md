Tiny ImageNet: (https://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports/2017/pdfs/930.pdf)

I downloaded Tiny ImageNet - it is 236MB and then picked 10 classes to use. 

It has 100,000 images of 200 classes (500 per class), 64x64 colored images, with 500 training, 50 validation, and 50 test images per class.

I also created a dataloader in colab: dataloader_notebook.ipynb. I have stored the partial dataset on googledrive at [tiny-imagenet-200] (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yYI9fMnjiYoO_UtnpLyROu---5OFa1eo?usp=drive_link)
